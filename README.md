# Hi there, I'm Eleonora 👋  

**ISTQB Certified Test Automation Engineer | SDET | Quality Advocate**

## 🚀 About Me

I’m an ISTQB-certified Test Automation Engineer with over 5 years of experience building robust UI and API test frameworks, scaling quality practices, and promoting testing as a core part of engineering. Beyond the hands-on work, I’ve taken ownership of leading testing efforts on projects — from designing test strategies to coordinating with cross-functional teams.

To me, quality means more than just passing tests — it’s about delivering products that meet real user expectations in real-world conditions. That includes timely, meaningful feedback to stakeholders and strong communication across teams to support informed decision-making.

Outside of work, I stay active in the tech community by leading study groups, [mentoring](https://www.womencodingcommunity.com/mentors?keywords=Eleonora%20Belova) aspiring testers and developers, and sharing practical testing insights through my blog. As part of my open-source contributions to the Women Coding Community, I focus on testing web and API features and building automation frameworks that support continuous delivery.

# Hi there, I'm Eleonora 👋  

**ISTQB Certified Test Automation Engineer | SDET | Quality Advocate**

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate QA Automation Engineer with 5+ years of experience building test automation frameworks, ensuring software quality at scale, and promoting testing as an engineering discipline. My expertise lies in designing and implementing both UI and API test frameworks which integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines. 

For me, quality is more than code coverage or green builds — it’s about ensuring the product works as expected for real users, under real conditions. I approach testing as an essential part of engineering, and I enjoy mentoring others to think that way too.

Outside of work, I stay active in the tech community. I lead study groups, mentor aspiring testers and developers, and share practical tips on software testing and automation through my blog. As part of my open-source contributions to the Women Coding Community, I focus on testing the website and APIs, and developing automation frameworks that are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to support the development.
